            <p>Good day, my name is Mustafa and I'm from Philadelphia, PA. I am a lover of the Hip Hop culture as I grew
                up in it. I love the history of the culture with a few elements of the culture, such as Breakdancing or
                bboying/bgirling, Deejaying, and Rap music starting in the South Bronx, NY. Little do most people know
                is that the 4th element of Hip Hop, graffiti, was started here in Philly!</p>
            <p>I spent many years competing in breakdancing across the country, and I also dabbled in graffiti since I
                was 13. Though I am now 38, I still dance from time to time, of course, there are things I cannot do
                anymore! However, the dance is still important and when ever I get the chance to get down with other
                bboys and bgirls, I'm all in!</p>
